This repository includes the code, resources, and output for two python-challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

1. PyBank

PyBank/PyBank_Resources contains a CSV file with monthly profit and loss statements.

PyBank/main.py contains code that will calculate the following:

      The total number of months included in the dataset
  
      The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  
      Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  
      The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
      The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
      
The outputs will print in the terminal window and be written into a text file which will save in PyBank/PyBank_Analysis



2. PyPoll

PyPoll/PyPoll_Resources contains a CSV file with election data.

PyPoll/main.py contains code that will calculate the following:

      The total number of votes cast

      A complete list of candidates who received votes

      The percentage of votes each candidate won

      The total number of votes each candidate won

      The winner of the election based on popular vote
      
The outputs will print in the terminal window and be written into a text file which will save in PyPoll/PyPoll_Analysis
